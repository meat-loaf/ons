-- fix/implement before any sort of proper release --

* Finish death->level transition
  * Restart at midway without ow transition and item memory
    already implemented. Implement post-death menu to abort
    level (a la yi)
  * Fix midway flag being set/used when exiting the level
    after midpoint has been set.
* Add post-goal-walk gamemode where points are tallied
  * Save these per-level somewhere
* Implement expanded sram saving properly, for the above
  * Save lives, coins, yoshi status, powerup status, score
    * lives/coins/powerup requires ow loading tweaks
* Score per-level, save this as well
* OW display of level percentage, score (sma2 menu like maybe?)

-- not important, but would be nice --
* Pendulum platforms have some oam positioning issues,
  they seem off-by-one in some cases when near the edge
  of the screen. Fix this.
