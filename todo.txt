* Finish death->level transition
  * Restart at midway without ow transition and item memory
    already implemented. Implement post-death menu to abort
    level (a la yi)
  * Fix midway flag being set/used when exiting the level
    after midpoint has been set.
* Add post-goal-walk gamemode where points are tallied
  * Save these per-level somewhere
* Implement expanded sram saving properly, for the above
  * Save lives, coins, yoshi status, powerup status, score
    * lives/coins/powerup requires ow loading tweaks
* Score per-level, save this as well
* OW display of level percentage, score (sma2 menu like maybe?)

* ~ambient sprites~
  * fireball freezing bug?
    * there is a bug that rarely occurs causing player fireballs
      to seemingly freeze when despawning offscreen to the left:
      ex. in level 105 if a powerup is placed close to spawn, grab it and
      shoot fireballs left; freeze when fireball touches edge of screen or so.
      seen only in snes9x so far.
  * compact ram better
    * ambient x/y speed accitentally tried to use layer1/2 delta
      ram (because smw is dumb and just throws stuff everywhere),
      and we will probably need at least one more table, so compact
      it a bit better...the normal sprites stuff can probably go where
      the ambient routine ptr etc are at the moment, as they take up
      far less space
      * this might be moot now, we have overworld ram available
  * minor extended stuff (sparkles for coins,
    sparkles for star coins)
    * maybe move these to a system like the one used for
      spinning turn blocks? they dont need much and it
      might be too much pressure on the 40 ambient slots
  * port gps' changemap16 routine to replace
    beb0 calls in bounce blocks, for slight performance gain
    and required for smb3 bricks to work as intended
-- not important, but would be nice --
* Pendulum platforms have some oam positioning issues,
  they seem off-by-one in some cases when near the edge
  of the screen. Fix this.
